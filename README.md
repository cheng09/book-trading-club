# Book Trading Club
I'm building this app as part of Free Code Camp's Back End certification process. The requirements/example app for the project can be found [on their site](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manage-a-book-trading-club).

## User Stories
- User Story: I can view all books posted by every user.
- User Story: I can add a new book.
- User Story: I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.
- User Story: I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

## Tech Stack/Tools Used
- MEAN stack:
    - Node.js
    - Express
    - MongoDB/Mongoose
    - Angular
- Angular Material
- Material Design Icons
- Google Books API / [google-books-search module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-books-search)

## Reference materials
(Will collect links later, when I'm not typing on my phone)
- Sitepoint tutorial for MEAN stack token-based authentication
- Codepen of Angular Material login page
- John Papa's Angular Style Guide, which has really helped clarify how Angular apps actually work, as well as how to structure my code so it is readable and modular.
